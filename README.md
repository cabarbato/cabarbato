# Colleen A. Barbato

I'm a Front End Engineer that does a lot of Full Stack stuff for a content marketing firm. I specialize in interactive data visualizations and web scraping, and I'm currently studing Typescript, React Native, and how to incorporate DevOps practices into our company's SDLC. I also enjoy drawing in my spare time, and I have previous experience in graphic and industrial design.
