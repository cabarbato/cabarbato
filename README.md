# Colleen A. Barbato

I'm a Software Engineer for a global technology consulting company. I specialize in front-end web and mobile development, particularly using React Native and Typescript. My favorite projects typically include data visualization and interactive storytelling. I also have experience with creating API's for Generative AI applications, implementing Jenkins Pipelines, using AWS services, and working with Python, Node.js, and PHP.

When I'm not working, I'm either aquascaping, drinking hot sauce, or reading comics. I also love drawing in my spare time, and I have previous experience in graphic and industrial design.
